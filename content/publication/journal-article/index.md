abstract: During the last decade, mobile communication has become the most sought-after mode of communication. However, the telecommunication market has reached a point of saturation and it is, in general very difficult for a company to bring a new customer. On the other hand, mobile number portability has become very easy. This has resulted in an ever-increased concept of churn, whereby a customer moves from one service provider to another. It is very important for telecommunication companies to predict which of the customers are most susceptible to move to their competitors. One can predict this move based on Call Detail Records (CDR). CDRs have features such as last call date, duration of a call, and data usage. Deep Learning is a relatively recent concept and has found many applications in pattern recognition, image processing, and other related domains. As such, in this research, we apply deep learning for churn prediction. For evaluation and analysis, we use the Mobile Telephony Churn Prediction Dataset. The dataset contains the data for around 100k individuals, out of which 86k individuals are non-churners whereas, 14k are the churned ones. From the evaluation of the proposed deep model, we achieve a 96% accurate model for the detection of churn and non-churn instances, thus, showing the efficacy of the approach for practical applications.
